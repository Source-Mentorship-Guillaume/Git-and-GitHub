# Git-and-GitHub

*This repository will help you understand the basics of version control. How do we make changes to a code base, track them, revert them etc...*

### Clone this repo.
Unlike other projects, where you will be asked to *fork* the repository - which means "working on your own copy" - here we will work directly on the original one.
First *clone* it on your local machine with either:
- If you're using HTTPS: `git clone https://github.com/Source-Mentorship-Guillaume/Git-and-GitHub.git`
- If you're using SSH keys to authenticate to Github: `git clone git@github.com:Source-Mentorship-Guillaume/Git-and-GitHub.git`.

Once done, make sure you are in the correct directory (type in `cd Git-and-Github`)
